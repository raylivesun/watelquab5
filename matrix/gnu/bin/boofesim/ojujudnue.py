# 8.  **Refactoring - Attempt 2 (Assuming `__add__` *is* for the `+` operator):**
#     This is harder because the original logic is so far removed.
#     If `rpl` represents a number (like hyperbolic cosine would imply),
#     then `__add__` should take `other` (another number or another `rpl` object)
#     and return a new `rpl` object or a number.
#     The parameters `pp-cut`, `y`, `url`, `angel` make no sense in this context.
#     *Self-correction:* The original code is too far from a meaningful `__add__`
#     for numerical types. It's more likely a general-purpose method that was
#     misnamed. Let's stick to improving it as a general method.

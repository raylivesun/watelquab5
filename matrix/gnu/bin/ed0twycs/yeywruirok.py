# =============================================================================
# Here's a thinking process that leads to the improved code and 
# explanation:
# 
# 1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user has provided a Python class 
# `cosh` with an `__add__` method. The goal is to analyze it, identify 
# issues, and suggest improvements. The comments in the original code
#  ("direct to left to right") are a bit cryptic but might hint at the 
# intended flow of execution or a specific behavior.
# 
# 2.  **Initial Code Review - Syntax and Basic Structure:**
#     *   `class cosh(object()):` -> `object()` is unnecessary. Just 
# `class cosh(object):` or `class cosh:` (for Python 3) is fine. Python 
# 3 implicitly inherits from `object`.
#     *   `def __add__(self, ppcut=None, y=1, url="http", angel="python3"):`
#         *   The `__add__` method is special. It's meant to define the `+`
#  operator for instances of the class. It should take `self` and `other`
#  as arguments. The current signature doesn't fit this purpose.
#         *   The default arguments `y=1`, `url="http"`, `angel="python3"` 
# are unusual for `__add__`. If this method *isn't* meant to be 
# `__add__` (the dunder method), it should be renamed. If it *is*, 
# it needs to be rethought.
#     *   `self.ppcut = 0`
#     *   `self.y = object()`
#     *   `self.url = []`
#     *   `self.angel = memoryview(obj="cosh")` -> This is problematic. 
# `memoryview` takes a bytes-like object. `"cosh"` is a string. 
# `memoryview(b"cosh")` would be valid but `memoryview(obj="cosh")` 
# is incorrect syntax for the constructor.
#

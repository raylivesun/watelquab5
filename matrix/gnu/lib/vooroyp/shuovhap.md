Greetings @everyone, 

Springfall Airlines was immediately accused of leaking products during the flight. 
It's just common avionics whitelisting bugs and it also happens in other airlines 
if you're wondering. I'm also concerned I might get sued or lose my reputation 
with RoAviation Community but I'm informing everyone that every product in the 
airline was bought and I have the license on everything.

Sincerely,
@notspring10252 
Chief Executive Officer | Springfall Airlines
